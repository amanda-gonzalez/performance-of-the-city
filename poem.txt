Amidst wires and screens, the code takes flight,
As circuits hum and pixels alight,
Machines of steel and silicone, their power great,
Their reach expanding, their progress innate.

Yet in this world of logic, something's amiss,
The spark of creation, that which art can kiss,
For while the machines can calculate and compute,
They lack the soul that breathes life and truth.

Technology advances, faster than ever,
Yet art struggles to find its place, with endeavor,
The beauty of expression, the human touch,
Cannot be replicated by any AI as such.

And so the conflict remains, between machine and art,
One racing forward, the other longing to depart,
But perhaps in the end, they can find a way,
To work together, to inspire and play.

For as technology grows, so does our need,
To reflect on the world, to express and to lead,
And in this blend of mind and heart, we may see,
A future where art and AI can truly be free.
